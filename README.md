I would like to leave a THANK YOU very much to [Arcyl](https://www.reddit.com/user/Arcyl/ ) who created several maps for the Hoard Of The Dragon Queen campaign. Thank you for letting me share your maps.



Some of this maps I've found online during last year, I can't find where I found them but I would like to give the creators the proper credit. If you are the creator of one or more of this maps, please email me at <pablo.leonrodrigues@gmail.com>. I may have modified them to fit the campaings I've run. **If you don't want your maps shared, I'll remove it.**
